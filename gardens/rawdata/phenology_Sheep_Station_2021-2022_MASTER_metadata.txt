This file contains all the phenology and growth observations for 
the Sheep Station common garden in 2021-2022 growing season.

Update MLV 14 April 2023

Site = unique site ID (categorical, 1 level; ["SheepStation"])
Date = date of measurement (MM/DD/YYYY)
Plot = unique plot number (categorical, 40 levels; 1-40); DENSITY and ALBEDO treatments are assigned at the plot level
Density = density treatment, manipulating space between plants within a plot (categorical, 2 levels; ["high", "low"])
Albedo = albedo treatment, manipulating gravel color on top of soil (categorical, 2 levels; ["black", "white"])
x = x-coordinate of location of plant within a plot (continuous, [1-20]); for LOW density plots range is [1,20] and for HIGH density range is [1,10]
y = y-coordinate of location of plant within a plot (continuous, [1-10]); for LOW density plots range is [1,5] and for HIGH density range is [1,10]
genotype = unique genotype ID (categorical, 84 levels; ["1", "2", "5", ..., "105"]); see "sitecode2genotypenumber.csv" for genotype info)
growout = year of greenhouse growout (categorical, 2 levels; ["2020", "2021"] 
source = original seed collection site (categorical, 84 levels; [e.g., "Symstad6", "Chynoweth02"...]); unique source for each genotype
lat = latitude of source seed collection (continuous, [34.06, 50.09])
lon = longitude of source seed collection (continuous, [-120.67, -101.94])
Live = is plant alive for measurement? (categorical, 3 levels, ["missing", "N", "Y"]
V = phenology stage (ordinal/categorical, 9 levels, ["NA", "missing", "FG" > "BS" > "V3+" > "V3" > "V2" > "V1" > "V0"]); FG = flowering green, BS = boot stage
height = height of plant (continuous, centimeters, [0.1, 11.7] OR NA); NAs for missing or dead stems and for live stems of all stages?
Length_mm = height of plant (continuous, millimeters, [1, 117] OR NA); same as HEIGHT column multiplied by 10
herbivory = evidence of herbivory on plant? (categorical, 3 levels; ["N", "Y", NA])
frost_heave = evidence of frost heave? (categorical, 3 levels; ["N", "Y", NA])
tillers = EMPTY COLUMN
harvested = EMPTY COLUMN
notes = notes on plant/measurement (categorical, 106 levels; [e.g., "ALL FLOWERS DIED", "2 CM S", "HEAVY HERBIVORY"])
