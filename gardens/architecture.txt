Tables we need to link records:

	Genotype / collection site info

	Garden- Plot - Treatment 

	PlantID - Garden - Year - Genotype - Plot - X - Y

Raw data tables:

	For each garden:
		-individual growth and phenology
		-individual harvest info (biomass, seed counts)

Derived output:
	
	-individual growth x year x Julian day (long or wide?)

	-individual phenology x year x Julian day (long or wide?)

	-individual x year x biomass/fecundity (long)
