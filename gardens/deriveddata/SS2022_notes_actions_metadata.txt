Field notes about individual plants. Notes are compiled and then written
to a file in the derrived data directory. We then went through that 
file by hand, adding new columns for actions to take.

notes: original note recorded in field
action: ignore or flag
standard_note: translation of the original note into a few categories to match existing flags
