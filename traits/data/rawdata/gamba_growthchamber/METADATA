Gamba et al. growth chamber data

cheatgrass_biomass_cg.csv
PopNum = numeric code for population; note: this is different than the numeric genotype code
tray = tray in the growth chamber in which plant was grown (numeric; 1-15)
veg_biomass_mg = dry vegetative biomass (milligrams)
rep_biomass_mg = dry reproductive / inflorescence biomass (milligrams)
TotalDryBiomass_mg = total dry biomass (veg_biomass_mg + rep_biomass_mg)

cheatgrass_Rpheno_cg.csv
PopNum = numeric code for population; note: this is different than the numeric genotype code
tray = tray in the growth chamber in which plant was grown (numeric; 1-15)
DaysToFlower = number of days from seed planting to observed first day of flowering (when awn tips could be seen through the boot)
InflorHeight_cm = total plant height from the soil surface to the top of the longest inflorescence (centimeters). Inflorescences were straightened for measurement so more of "length" than "height".
InflorNumber = number of inflorescences

cheatgrass_seed_cg.csv
PopNum = numeric code for population; note: this is different than the numeric genotype code
tray = tray in the growth chamber in which plant was grown (numeric; 1-15)
seedM = dry seed mass (milligrams)
seedN = estimated seed count (calculated from seedM / seed1M)
seed1M = mass of individual seed (milligrams)

cheatgrass_Vpheno_cg.csv
PopNum = numeric code for population; note: this is different than the numeric genotype code
tray = tray in the growth chamber in which plant was grown (numeric; 1-15)
SeedlingHeight_cm = height of seedling measured after 10 week vernalization, ~12 weeks after planting (centimeters)
AdultHeight_cm = height of adult plant measured at harvest ~250 days after planting (centimeters)
SpringGrowth_cm = growth of plant between 10 week vernalization and harvest at ~250 after planting (AdultHeight_cm - SeedlingHeight_cm; centimeters)
tillersN = total number of tillers at harvest 
leavesN = total number of leaves at harvest
