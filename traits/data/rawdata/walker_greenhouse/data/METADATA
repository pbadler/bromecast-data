Data from Hana Walker's summer 2023 greenhouse experiment

ID = unique plant ID
Genotype ID = numeric genotype code
Seed wt. (g) = weight of individual seed before planting (grams)
Seed ProjArea (cm2) = 2D area of individual seed before planting (cm2)
Time to emergence (d) = number of days until emergence observed
Plant ht. 21d (cm) = plant height measured 21 days after seed planting (cm)
Plant ht. 35d (cm) = plant height measured 35 days after seed planting (cm)
Leaf no. 21d = number of leaves on plant observed 21 days after seed planting
Leaf no. 35d = number of leaves on plant observed 35 days after seed planting
Tiller no. 35d = number of tillers on plant observed 35 days after seed planting
Shoot dry wt. (g) = dry aboveground biomass (grams)
Shoot leaf area (cm2) = surface area of aboveground biomass (cm2)
Root dry wt (g) = dry belowground biomass (grams)
Root length (cm) = cumulative root length (cm)
Root ProjArea(cm2) = 2D root area (cm2)
Root SurfArea (cm2) = root surface area (cm2)
Root AvgDiamm (mm) = average root diameter (mm)
Root vol. (cm3) = root volume (cm3)
